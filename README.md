### About

Matrix Transform Algorithms is a simple java code that changes 2D array data into different data arrangements.

It includes 4 different algorithms:
- Clockwise Spiral
- Counterclockwise Spiral
- Row
- Column

The program is built over the Decorator design pattern that defines how the transformation must be arranged and Generics to define the matrix data type.
